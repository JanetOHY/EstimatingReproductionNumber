# Fine-scale estimation of effective reproduction numbers for dengue surveillance

# Motivation
The effective reproduction number Rt is an epidemiological quantity that provides an instantaneous measure of transmission potential of an infectious disease. While dengue is an increasingly important vector-borne disease, few have used Rt as a measure to inform public health operations and policy for dengue. This study demonstrates the utility of Rt for realtime dengue surveillance. Using nationally representative, geo-located dengue case data from Singapore over 2010â€“2020, we estimated Rt by modifying methods from Bayesian (EpiEstim) and filtering (EpiFilter) approaches, at both the national and local levels.
